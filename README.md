<li>Download Webstorm from the jetbrains' website <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#classrooms">here</a> then fill out all student information to gain a free license to the software. If there is no access then reach out to the support and show them either a student id or transcript to prove enrollment.</li>
<li>Set up a <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a> using your email of choice typically using your school email</li>
<li>Open Webstorm go to settings and scroll down to the version control tab in order to link your GitHub account to Webstorm as well as making sure Git is pathed correctly to Webstorm</li>
<li>There are two different ways to make repositories; In Webstorm by clicking on the Version Control tab and then going to the Git tab, hover over the GitHub menu and then click share project. For GitHub simply press the + symbol on the top right of the webpage.  </li>
<li>If you want to clone a repository from an online source then you can go the to Git tab and click on clone then enter the URL for the repository.</li>
<li>In order to create a new file then hit "File" -> "New" and then choose HTML finally name the file.</li>
<li>After you are done with your file you will go to the Git tab hit commit with a message that is meaningful to the change.</li>
