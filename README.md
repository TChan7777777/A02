PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Step 1: download webstorm- using this link https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students
Step 2: install git as a local program- using this link https://git-scm.com/downloads
Step 3: setup github- creating a github account using your njit email
Step 4: connecting github with webstorm- using (Ctrl+Alt+S) choose Version control Git and the enter the path to the git.exe
Step 5: Add your github password to webstorm- using (Ctrl+Alt+S) choose Appearance and Behavior | System Settings | Passwords
Step 6: Create a repository through github
Step 7: Then import the repository to webstorm using the local link from github
Step 8: Now that the repository clone is created we can edit and create files.


Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

**Branch**: A separate line of development within a Git repository. Branches allow developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's code.
**Clone**: The process of creating a copy of a repository on your local machine. Cloning allows you to work on the code locally without affecting the original repository.
**Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in a Git repository. It represents a specific point in the project's history and typically includes a message describing the changes made.
**Fetch**: Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository and updates your local repository's remote-tracking branches, but it doesn't merge those changes into your own branches.
**Git**: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently. It tracks changes to files over time and facilitates collaboration among team members.
**GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on code. It provides tools for managing projects, reviewing code, and facilitating collaboration among developers.
**Merge**: The process of combining changes from different branches into one. When you merge branches, Git automatically integrates the changes and resolves any conflicts that may arise.
**Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches due to conflicting modifications to the same file or lines of code. Resolving merge conflicts requires manual intervention from the developer.
**Push**: Pushing refers to uploading local repository changes to a remote repository. It updates the remote repository with the changes you've made locally.
**Pull**: Pulling retrieves changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local repository. It's essentially a combination of the fetch and merge commands.
**Remote**: A remote is a reference to a repository hosted on a different server. It allows you to interact with and synchronize changes with repositories on remote servers, such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
**Repository**: A repository, or repo, is a collection of files and version history managed by Git. It contains all the project files, along with metadata such as commit history, branches, and tags.
